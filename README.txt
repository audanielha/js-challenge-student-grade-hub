Challenge: Student Grade Book
You are tasked with creating a simple student grade book system. This system will allow you to manage student records and calculate their average grades.

Requirements:
Create an array named students that will hold objects. Each object represents a student and should have the following properties:

id (a unique number for each student)

name (a string for the student's name)

grades (an array of numbers representing the student's grades)

Add at least 3 students to the students array. Ensure each student has a unique id and an array of grades.

Write a function named addStudent that takes in a student object as a parameter and adds it to the students array.

Write a function named removeStudent that takes in a student id and removes the student with that id from the students array.

Write a function named addGrade that takes in a student id and a grade, and adds the grade to the student's grades array.

Write a function named calculateAverageGrade that takes in a student id and calculates and returns the average grade of the student.
